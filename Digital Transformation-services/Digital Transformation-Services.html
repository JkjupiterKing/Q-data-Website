        Digital transformation refers to the comprehensive integration of
        digital technologies into all aspects of an organization, fundamentally
        altering how businesses operate and deliver value to customers. This
        transformation goes beyond merely adopting new technologies; it involves
        a cultural shift that encourages challenging the status quo, fostering
        experimentation, and embracing change across the organization. Digital
        transformation is a strategic approach that leverages technology to
        create value, improve decision-making, and foster growth, ensuring that
