        Data mining often referred to as web mining, involves extracting
        valuable information from web data to uncover patterns, trends, and
        insights. This process is integral to various applications, including
        marketing, user behavior analysis, and content personalization. While
        web mining offers numerous benefits, it's essential to consider ethical
        issues such as user privacy, data consent, and compliance with
        regulations like GDPR. Ensuring transparency and obtaining proper
        consent are crucial when collecting and analyzing web data.
