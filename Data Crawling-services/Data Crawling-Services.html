        Data crawling, often referred to as web crawling, is the automated
        process of systematically browsing and collecting information from the
        internet. Utilizing specialized programs known as crawlers or spiders,
        data crawling enables the extraction of vast amounts of data from
        websites for various purposes. While data crawling is a powerful tool
        for collecting information, it's crucial to conduct it responsibly,
        respecting both legal frameworks and ethical norms to maintain the
        integrity of data collection practices.
